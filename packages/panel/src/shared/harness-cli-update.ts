/**
 * One-click CLI updates for the managed agents.
 *
 * The per-platform update commands in HARNESS_CLI_CONFIG are alternatives, not
 * steps — which one is safe to run depends on how the CLI was installed
 * (`npm install -g` over a brew install leaves two binaries shadowing each
 * other). The install method is sniffed from the resolved binary's real path
 * and the matching command is picked; unknown installs prefer the CLI's own
 * self-updater, which updates in place regardless of origin.
 *
 * The renderer only ever sends an agent id over IPC — the command is chosen
 * in the main process from this compiled-in config, so no shell string
 * crosses the IPC boundary.
